<b>What is Louna</b>
1)Clojure library over Apache Spark's Java API.
2)Wrappers over the Java API for simpler use of
   RDDs 
   Dataframes/Datasets 
   Structured Streaming API
3)Logic based query DSL

Designed to be easy to use and easy to use with Spark.

Clojure and data processing,is a perfect match.
Spark runs on JVM also so it can be easily used throw Java API.
This allows us to use Spark with the beauty and simplicity of Clojure.

<span id="data"></span>

<b>Why Clojure/Louna for data applications?</b>

Clojure is great for data applications.
Data applications = code,data processing,querying data

1)Code
  Clojure is a general programming language.
  It can be used in any type of application.
  It run on JVM and its very simple to use Java from Clojure. 
  

2)Data processing
  Functional programming is great for data processing.
  Because functional programming is about chaining,and data processing is chaining.
  (chaining meaning the result of a function is argument of the next function,
   not do something,store it in memory,do something else,and reload it sometime to continue)

  Either you write it 
  1)In the more functional programmming style like 
    <div class="code">(f1 (f2  (f3 ..))) </div>
    *for code or for mixed code and data processing

  2)In the more data processing style like 
    <div class="code">
    (-> f1
        (f2 ..)
        (f3 ..))
    </div>
    *used for bigger chains of data tranformations

  Clojure syntax serves both programming styles.


2)Querying data

  Quering languages are declarative and their roots are in logic.
  Clojure with its powerfull macros can be extended to create a declarative and logic based
  query languge.

  Doing that we have one general programmming language that can also process data,and query
  the data,in a natural way.

  Comparison with other approaches for quering the data.

  1)Object oriented languages 
    they made to support state based programming not chaining,you can use them for chaining
    but they are not natural for data processing and they have even bigger problems when it 
    comes to quering the data

  2)SQL
    SQL is very good for quering the data but its not a general programming language and to use it
    you have to seperate programming code from quering code,different functions different programming style.
    Also SQL is not logical query language.

  3)Mix for example scala that you write sql expressions as strings
    Again the querying is seperated but its mixed in an unatural way like writing code inside strings.
    Code in strings have many problems for example variable usage.
    
  Louna is made to combine the 3 approaches,in a simple programmable data processing/query language.

  Query in scala and louna (from spark the definitive guide book 2018)


  Louna 
<div class="codelong">

    (q  df
        ((.and (=_ ?StockCode "DOT") (.or (>_ ?UnitPrice 600)
                                          (includes? ?Description "POSTAGE"))) ?expensive)
        ((?expensive))
        [?expensive ?unitPrice]
        (.show 5))

</div>

  Scala 
<div class="codelong">

    val DOTCodeFilter = col("StockCode") === "DOT"
    val priceFilter = col("UnitPrice") > 600
    val descripFilter = col("Description").contains("POSTAGE") 
    df.withColumn("isExpensive", DOTCodeFilter.and(priceFilter.or(descripFilter)))
      .where("isExpensive")
      .select("unitPrice", "isExpensive")
      .show(5)  

</div>

  SQL
<div class="codelong">

    SELECT UnitPrice, (StockCode = 'DOT' AND
          (UnitPrice > 600 OR instr(Description, "POSTAGE") >= 1)) as isExpensive
    FROM dfTable
    WHERE (StockCode = 'DOT' AND
          (UnitPrice > 600 OR instr(Description, "POSTAGE") >= 1))
    LIMIT 5

</div>

  Another query using scala and sql expression

  Louna
<div class="codelong">
    (q staticDataFrame
       [?CustomerId ((*_ ?UnitPrice ?Quantity) ?total_cost) ?InvoiceDate]
       (groupBy ?CustomerId (functions/window ?InvoiceDate "1 day"))
       (g/sum ?total_cost)
       (.show 5)) 

</div>

  Scala/SQL expression

<div class="codelong">
    staticDataFrame
    .selectExpr("CustomerId",
                "(UnitPrice * Quantity) as total_cost",
                "InvoiceDate")
    .groupBy(col("CustomerId"), window(col("InvoiceDate"), "1 day"))
    .sum("total_cost")
    .show(5)    

</div>

  Louna that is used for querying the data,is declarative,logic based,and compact.

Clojure is ideal language for data applications,because it can do all those 3 in a natural way,
and using 1 language.

Clojure native functions can be used in RDD's , in Datasets , and as UDF's.
For example to declare a UDF in louna 
(defudf myudf1 (fn [x] (* x 2)) 1 :long)
Or you can use any clojure function instead of anonymous.

<b>Why Louna for Spark</b>

  1)Because Spark is for writing data processing applications,in which Clojure is very good.
  2)Spark supports Java,Clojure runs on JVM with very good java interoperability.
    You can use the Java API thought Clojure,and still have a less verbose syntax than Java,
    but if you wrapper the Java you can reduce it even more,and if you make a DSL like louna,
    the complexity is heavily reduced.
  3)Louna is translated to java spark code,so its like using the Java API
  4)Louna dont restrict spark for example inside queries you can write any spark java api code.
    For example

<div class="codelong">
     (q (flightData2015 ?dest - ?count)
        (groupBy ?dest)
        (g/sum ?count)
        (rename "sum(count)" ?destTotal)
        (order-by (desc ?destTotal))
        (.limit 5)
        (.show))

</div>

     Louna code is mixed with the Java api.
     q after converting the query to normal spark code is just -> macro.
     Here .limit and .show is used ,you can use like that any Java api code.
     Louna makes the writing for Java code simplier by wrapping Java functions or by allow collumns
     to be named ?var (louna makes it to (functions/col "var"))
     
     Louna is far from complete Spark api,but it doesn't restrict spark so its usable even now.

Clojure can make Spark usage simple,i think more simple than the Scala/Java/SQL/Python alternatives.
